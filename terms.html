  <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>You should read these Terms because they contain our legal commitments to you and a number of DOs and DON'Ts which you need to be aware of when you use our Services. Please read these Terms carefully to make sure you understand them. By using our Services, you are automatically deemed to agree to accept and be legally bound by these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt if you do not agree with the Terms, you should not proceed to access or use our Services.</p>
  <p>You should also read our Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy explains how we use your personal data.</p>
  <p>If you think that there is a mistake in these terms or have any queries, please contact us to discuss.</p>
  <p>If we have to contact you, we will do so by writing to you at the email address you have provided to us. It is therefore very important that you confirm you have provided a legitimate email address that is used by you personally and by proceeding with use of our Services you warrant that you have done so. We will only contact you if you have given explicit consent for us to do so. The only other time you will receive emails is where you have registered to receive our newsletter and updates.</p>
  <p>When we use the words "writing" or "written" in these terms, this includes emails.</p>

  <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We can update and change these Terms from time to time and the most current version of these Terms will be posted on the website and relevant app. You may be invited to review and accept the revised Terms in order to continue using the Services. We suggest all users regularly check the terms on the website and in-app where any changes will be posted. You can print and save a copy of these Terms for your future reference.</p>
  <p>We may require you to update software to be able to use the Services, provided that the Services will continue to match the description of it that we provided to you before.</p>
  <p>The associated software may be upgraded to reflect changes in an operating system. By continuing to use the Services you will be deemed to have accepted the Terms as varied from time to time.</p>

  <h2>Using Our Service / Buying Coins</h2>
  <p>To use our service, you will need to have a virtual wallet. We draw your attention that wallets are third-party services, and we advise you to read their terms of use.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Security is important to Decentralized LaunchPad, and you therefore agree not to share your wallet access with any other user or third party, or knowingly carry out any activity which enables a third party to access or use your account. If we believe, acting in our discretion, that your account is used inappropriately, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate or cease to support your account without liability.</p>
  <p>We cannot check the identities of people using our Services and will not be liable if your wallet connection or account is used by someone else. If you become aware of any unauthorised use of your login, you should notify us immediately by contacting us at deentalizedlaunch.com, using 'Security Breach' as the subject line. Please note that we may need to verify your identity and validate ownership of the account. Be alert for other websites and services which may pretend to be us or to be associated with us.</p>
